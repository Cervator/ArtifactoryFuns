Job DSL plugin - powers automagic job creation (possibly could wire in better with JCasC sometime as well?)
Templating Engine - powers the module mega-builds (centralized Jenkinsfiles and such)
Javadoc - Well, yeah
Warnings Next Generation - Tons of post-build analytics - Checkstyle, SpotBugs, etc
Discord Notifier - Used for the DestSol channel, but nothing else yet. May want to either expand or eliminate
Copy Artifact - used to copy in the "build harness" for Terasology module builds (files attached like artifacts to the engine jobs)
Permissive Script Security - we hatesss it, preciousss - but we must have it, so at least make it less painful... avoids some obnoxious security features
Basic Branch Build Strategies Plugin - allows extra config for when to build things, like tags
Groovy - for executing system Groovy steps to aid maintenance of Jenkins itself
https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-forensics/ (used by the engine build)
https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-gitstatuswrapper/ (used by the module build)
Thinbackup - for backup and restore to another Jenkins
